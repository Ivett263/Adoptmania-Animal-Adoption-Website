## Project Overview:
Adoptmania is an inclusive online platform that serves as a bridge between pet adopters and those wishing to put animals up for adoption. Users can explore a diverse range of animals, view their profiles, and initiate the adoption process. The website is built with a user-friendly interface to ensure a seamless experience for both adopters and moderators.

### Key Features:
- **Pet Listings:** A comprehensive list of pets available for adoption, including those listed by individuals. Those who wish to list their pets must complete a form, and once validated, the listing is displayed with images and detailed descriptions.
- **Adoption Process:** Users can follow a straightforward process to express their interest in adopting a pet.
- **List Your Pet for Adoption:** Individuals can register on the platform and complete a form to list their pets for adoption. Moderators review and validate the listings before they are displayed on the platform.
- **Moderator Tools:** Moderators have access to tools for reviewing and approving pet listings, ensuring the safety and accuracy of the information.
- **Search Functionality:** A search bar allows users to search for pets using keywords, making it easy to find animals that match specific criteria.
